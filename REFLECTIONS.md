## üß† What I Learned

I gained a better understanding of how plain JavaScript is used in browser-based interactivity thanks to this project. Event listeners and DOM manipulation felt a little robotic at first, but everything clicked (literally) when I began to see the webpage update in real time, including the click counter and color changes.

Among the important ideas I worked on were:
- Using `getElementById()` to dynamically create and select HTML elements
- The DOM is updated in reaction to user input.
- To maintain high scores throughout browser sessions, use `localStorage`.
- Using conditionals (`if`, `switch`) to write humorous, expressive messages
- Creating a simple user interface with emojis and CSS that provides incremental feedback

I gained confidence from the project in using only HTML, CSS, and JS instead of frameworks or libraries.

## üß© Challenges I Faced

Determining how to alter the background colors for every milestone was one of the biggest obstacles. Hard-coding hex colors was my first attempt, but it felt monotonous and repetitive. I eventually researched how to create soft, random RGB tones, and it was gratifying to figure out how to incorporate that into my event logic.

Additionally, I had to troubleshoot GitHub Pages because I initially forgot to enable it. I was perplexed as to why the HTML wasn't showing after pushing everything, but it was resolved after a minute of waiting and turning on Pages in settings.

## ‚≠ê Things I'm Proud Of

I'm pleased that I went above and beyond the assignment's requirements to transform the "cookie clicker" into something more imaginative and unique. The concept of seedling growth seems novel and relevant.

I had the opportunity to polish the user experience by including milestone messages, background changes, and even a reset button. I also found that writing it in my own style with informal remarks made it simpler for me to comprehend and explain.

## üîÑ What I Would Do Differently

When a seedling "grows," I would add a little animation or particle effect; record a click history or growth graph over time; and use audio feedback for milestones if I could do this over again or had more time.
Perhaps even rewrite the script with modular code or ES6 arrow functions.

## üöÄ Final Thoughts

This seemed like the ideal way to introduce interactive web applications. It showed me that it's more important to experiment, run the page, check for errors, and make adjustments as you go rather than knowing everything at once.

I now see how minor features can give a webpage a sense of life and interaction, and I have a better understanding of event-driven programming. üå±

As I progress through CS 81, I'm looking forward to creating even more entertaining and interactive JavaScript applications!
