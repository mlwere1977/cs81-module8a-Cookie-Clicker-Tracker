## 🔍 Overview

This interactive browser clicker game with a seedling theme is entertaining.  
Your "seedlings grown" counter increases each time you press the 🌱 button!  
Your progress is tracked by entertaining milestone messages, and your **high score** is automatically saved.

**JavaScript**, **localStorage**, and **DOM events** power the game.

## 🎯 Learning Goals

- Practice with JavaScript's `addEventListener()`; use `document.getElementById()` to work with DOM elements.
- Use `localStorage` to store data locally.
- Use conditionals to generate feedback and interaction.
- Write code that is clear, easy to read, enjoyable, and feels unique.

## 💡 How It Works

- To "grow" a new seedling, click the 🌱 icon.
- With every click, your total increases.
- The background color changes and new personalized messages (complete with emojis!) appear at specific milestones (10, 25, 50, 100, etc.).
- Even if you refresh or return later, your **best click record** will remain locally saved.
- Resetting your session at any moment won't impact your record.
